# ðŸ§  Auto-Pusher for Gitea

A fully-automated, zero-click Git auto-committing and pushing system â€” perfect for homelabbers, lone-wolf devs, and anyone working outside bloated IDEs.

### ðŸ’» Features

- ðŸ“¦ Automatically detects changes in a local project folder
- ðŸ’¨ Commits and pushes every X minutes (default: 5 min)
- ðŸ§ª Initializes Git and sets remote if missing
- ðŸ§  Tracks first commit if the repo is clean
- ðŸŒˆ ASCII banners, progress bars, and sexy logging
- ðŸ§¾ Self-hosted Git support (Gitea, GitLab, etc.)

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git installed and available in your PATH
- A Gitea repo URL and an API token

### ðŸš€ Setup

1. Clone your project locally
2. Configure the script variables at the top:
   - `PROJECT_DIR`
   - `USERNAME`, `TOKEN`, `GITEA_HOST`, `REPO_PATH`

3. Set your Git identity (one-time):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

4. Run the script:
```python auto-pusher.py```


ðŸ’¡ Why This Script?
Most IDEs like PyCharm are deeply tied to GitHub or GitLab and donâ€™t handle self-hosted Gitea smoothly. 

This script:
Works with any Git server
Doesnâ€™t need manual commits or GUIs
Is easy to drop into multiple folders for version control
